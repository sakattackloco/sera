<body>
One of the aims of the SERIES project is to improve dissemination
and use of experimental results, to foster the impact of earthquake engineering research on
practice, innovation and earthquake risk mitigation and to provide a broad and solid base for the
calibration of numerical models. This requires harmonization and unification of database
activities and the possibility of accessing data through a unique portal, by providing a centralized
access to different database nodes distributed over the network and able to communicate with a
central portal in a uniform manner.
