<b>Notes on the usage of filters:</b>
<br />
 * If you select more than one filter they are logically connected by an AND operator e.g Filter and show only the records that come from EU (EU:Yes) AND Represent and Organization (Is Org:Yes).
    <br />
    * Some of the filters are consisted of "multi-select lists". You can, for example, use the "country" filter and view the records that come from either "Italy" OR "Belgium". Notice that these are connected with OR operator (Italy or Belgium). In order to select more than one value you have to keep "Ctrl" key pressed along with clicking to separate values  or keep "Shift" key pressed and click on two values to select the range of values between them (exactly like selecting files in Windows). If you Ctrl+Click on a selected value, you can deselect it.
    <br />
    * To reset the stakeholders list and view again all records, just click again at the Stakeholders tab (icon). (or deselect all selected filters with Ctrl+Click like mentioned above and hit the "APPLY" button again)
